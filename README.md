# Algorithm.Assn2
Algorithm and Analysis assignment two, in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/CY1223">Chin</a>.  
The program generate maze use Hunt and Kill algorithm, and Kruskal algorithm.   
Then solve maze use normal solver and recursive backtracker solver.  

To compile on server:  
javac -cp .:mazeSolver/SampleSolver.jar *.java
